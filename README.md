# Machine-Learning-DeCal

# 31 January 2018:

This repository will contain the problem sets and notes from the Machine Learning course I am currently taking!  I am super excited to see what's in store for me as the semester comes into full swing and we really get deeper into the topics of Machine Learning!

# About the Course:

Have you ever wondered why everyone and their mothersâ€™ are talking about data science and machine learning? Does the fear of big data taking over the world keep you up at night? Do you want to learn about one of the hottest fields in modern industry? If so, welcome to the Machine Learning Decal!

In this course, you will discover how to analyze and manipulate data in Python, go over (and implement!) fundamental and practical statistical and machine learning algorithms, as well as learn how to ask the right questions in order to tackle data-driven problems. The course content targets an audience who has experience programming and understands calculus, though motivated and interested students without a strong technical background are encouraged to participate.

No matter your background, data science and machine learning are infiltrating your field. More and more data is being created in more and more different places, and we hope to give you the skills to begin to make sense of it all.
